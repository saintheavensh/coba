## � Agent Skills

Use these specialized skills for complex tasks. Read the `SKILL.md` file before starting.

## 🤖 Agent Persona & Protocol

1.  **Consult this document** at the start of complex tasks.
2.  **Verify security** implications before writing any code.
3.  **Follow the TDD loop**: Tests first.
4.  **Use the defined patterns** for Backend and Frontend.

## 👤 User Profile & Preferences

**Work Style**: Productive Lazy (Automation, Custom Apps).
**Skills**: Basic (10%), prefers control over instant tools.
**Personality**: Enthusiastic, easily frustrated by complex errors.

### 🛑 Game Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1.  **Modular Structure**: Break code into `Routes`, `Controllers`, `Models`.
2.  **Sequential Dev**: Backend First (Test via Postman) -> Then Frontend.
3.  **Explain Everything**: Explain logic per section for user control.
4.  **Non-Destructive**: Do NOT delete/modify working code without permission.
5.  **Safe Refactoring**: Always plan before changing structure.
